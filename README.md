# TextMiningR
This project uses text mining for sentiment of restaurant reviews. 
It attempts to go further than the normal project and identify sentiment of aspects of a restaurant like food, 
service, staff and ambiance. 

Through the use of web scraping, social media mining, and text mining analysis, better understanding of customer sentiment 
associated with different star ratings was the goal of the project. Sentiment analysis was stratified by different websites, 
locations, cuisines, and specific aspects of a restaurant. Lastly, comparison of how the association between sentiment and star rating
differs between websites like Yelp and Google reviews was performed.
